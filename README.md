App Evaluation

Category: Social Networking

Story: Allows users to make profiles and have their services advertised and provided to consumers who are looking for these services

Market: Our target market would be consumers who are looking for services and business owners who are trying to provide those services

Habit: App could be used often or everyday, because even when customers are not looking for a service, they can save it for later.

Scope: First we would start with an app that allows businesses to register and create a portfolio for thier services, featuring pictures and videos. It will then evolve into a pintrest like application that connects users with these business portfolios.
